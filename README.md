The project represents a console game, called Rummikub.
It's main idea is that the winner, who has used all of his tiles wins, or if there are no tiles left in the deck, the player with least sum of his hand wins.
A player can remove his tiles, when making different types of combinations with his own tiles or these from the deck.
The combinations must consist of different sequential numbers in the same color or tiles with different colors, but in the same numbers.
It is really interseting game, developing the mathematical and logical thinking.
